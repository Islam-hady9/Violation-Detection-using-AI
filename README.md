# Traffic Violation Detection Using AI and Yolov8 Algorithm

## Description:

Our project aims to develop a sophisticated traffic violation detection system using artificial intelligence (AI) technology and the Yolov8 algorithm. The system utilizes surveillance cameras deployed at strategic locations along roadways, highways, and intersections to capture live video footage of traffic flow. Leveraging the Yolov8 algorithm's advanced object detection capabilities, the system identifies various types of car violations, including speeding, running red lights, illegal parking, and improper lane usage, in real-time.

## Key Features:

- High Accuracy: The Yolov8 algorithm ensures precise detection of car violations with minimal false positives, enhancing enforcement accuracy and reliability.
- Real-time Detection: The system operates in real-time, enabling immediate identification and response to violations as they occur, thereby enhancing road safety and enforcement efficiency.
- Versatility: The Yolov8 algorithm's versatility allows for the detection of various types of car violations, making the system adaptable to different traffic scenarios and regulatory requirements.
- Scalability: The project is designed to be scalable, enabling the deployment of camera systems across diverse road networks and geographic locations for comprehensive coverage and enforcement capabilities.
- User-Friendly Interface: The system features an intuitive user interface with interactive dashboards and alerts for law enforcement personnel, facilitating efficient management and response to detected violations.
- Data Analytics: Incorporating data analytics capabilities enables the aggregation and analysis of violation data over time, providing valuable insights for informed decision-making, policy formulation, and targeted enforcement strategies.
